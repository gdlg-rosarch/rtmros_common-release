ros-groovy-openrtm-ros-bridge (1.0.7-0oneiric) oneiric; urgency=high

  * openrtm_ros_bridge: (test_myservice_rosbridge.test) add retry=4
  * openrtm_ros_bridge: mv samples/test_myservice_rosbridge.* -> test/test_myservice_rosbridge.* and add test to CMakeLists.txt/catkin.cmake
  * disable openrtm_ros_bridge/rosbuil test for now
  * Wrong catkin macro (CATKIN-DEPENDS to CATKIN_DEPENDS).
  * use pkg-config to find directories
  * disable test_myservice_rosbridge.launch, is is not working right now
