Description: hrpsys_ros_bridge package provides basic functionalities to bind hrpsys, a OpenRTM-based controller, and ROS. By using this package, you can write your ROS packages that communicate with your non-ROS robots that run on hrpsys. For communicating with the robots that run on OpenRTM without hrpsys, you can use openrtm_ros_bridge package.
