%description
hrpsys_ros_bridge package provides basic functionalities to bind hrpsys, a
OpenRTM-based controller, and ROS. By using this package, you can write your ROS
packages that communicate with your non-ROS robots that run on hrpsys. For
communicating with the robots that run on OpenRTM without hrpsys, you can use
openrtm_ros_bridge package.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
